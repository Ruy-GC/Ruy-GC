- Hi, I’m @Ruy-GC.
- I’m interested in web development, videogame development and multiple programming languages. Also I´m interested about how AI and machine learning work and learn how to work with it in the future.
- I’m currently learning to use unity and C# for game development and I´m a college student on my third semester in a computer science.
- I’m looking forward to get an internship in microsoft, facebook or google.
